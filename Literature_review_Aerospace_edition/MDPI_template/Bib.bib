abstract = {To reduce the regional environmental impacts of air traffic flow, this study investigated a green trajectory optimization method for reducing greenhouse effect. According to the characteristics of the regional sector aircraft and the flight conflict resolution method, the influences of CO2 emissions and aircraft contrails on global surface temperature change were analysed and a regional aircraft deployment model was established to minimise the greenhouse effect. A genetic algorithm based on the elite retention strategy was designed. The feasibility of this algorithm was verified using real flight operations data of ZBAAAR02 as an example. The calculation result shows that the model can effectively reduce the rise in global temperature due to flight operations in the sector. The global surface temperature can decrease by 98.74%, 97.69%, and 97.11% in 25, 50, and 100 years respectively with this model. The results obtained suggests that flight level allocation model optimisation can effectively reduce the greenhouse effect.},
